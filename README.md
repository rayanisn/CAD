# CAD

As part of our 4th year of engineering studies at ESME-SUDRIA, I was part of a team project during that aimed to make a prosthetic hand with limited functionalities and grip in 3 months. 
During this project, I was in charge of the 3D printing of the hand, which led me to both modifiy the CAD files using Solidworks to solve the issues we encountered and to use the 3D printers to produce the parts. 
We used files from a pre-existing open source prosthetic hand, the files present in this folder are only the ones that we modified to fit our limitations.
